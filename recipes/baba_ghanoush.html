    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Levantine appetizer consisting of finely chopped roasted aubergine, olive oil, lemon juice, various seasonings, and tahini. The aubergine is traditionally baked or broiled over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste. It is a typical meze ('starter') of the regional cuisine, often served as a side to a main meal and as a dip for pita bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Aubergine</li>
        <li>Tahini</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prick the aubergines with a fork. Grill the aubergines until the skin is charred and blacked and the flesh feels soft when you press it (this will take approximately 15-20 minutes, turning repeatedly through cooking until the whole skin is charred).</li>
        <li>In a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic with the lemon juice, tahini, olive oil and pepper.</li>
        <li>When cool enough to handle, cut the aubergines in half and scoop out the flesh. Mix the soft flesh with the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place in a serving dish and finish with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle the parsley over the top.</li>
    </ol>
